# i did a live stream again
Earlier today, I did a stream where i was ***gonna*** watch memes and play my game. However, due to lag, and my chromebook being a bit overloaded, I instead went with just playing my game. It was a 30 minute stream, and I didnt even get through every disaster. I was able to get every power up, though. It was pretty fun! Maybe you guys should check out my streams. Here are the links!
