# TurboZone and DBZone
Recently, I created a new project using Turbowarp and an extension that allowed me to fetch information from a link. Using this, and a text file uploaded to GitHub, I created a project called TurboZone. TurboZone has the ability to fetch information and do one of three things:  
- Show some text
- Embed an image/video/other link
- Redirect the user to a link  

This can be used to create a kind of social media where your posts are temporary. Anything you send to your TurboZone server is temporary, and will disappear forever when you replace it. That's what makes TurboZone so special. There are cool posts for people to document before they are lost to time.

## DBZone
DBZone is my TurboZone page. Anything I upload there is my own content, and once I start uploading there more frequently, there will be special sneak peeks of never before seen content, such as Scratch projects that are unfinished, I built this partially as an example of how TurboZone can be used, but mainly as a page for me to upload secret, never before seen stuff. Pretty cool, right? Here are some screenshots!
