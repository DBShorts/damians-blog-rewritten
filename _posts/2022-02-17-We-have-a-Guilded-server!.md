# We have a Guilded server!
Hello everyone! Since yesterday, I have been working on the setup of my Guilded server, and its finally done (almost)

It has almost everything that my discord server has, but doesnt have some of the bots and features. The reason for this is that I havent quite gotten those parts set up yet. However, it has all of the chats, color roles, and voice channels that the Discord server has, and more! Hope everyone enjoys.

The link is

 and it will be displayed at the top of the page from now on.
