# Blog + Projects Update
I got some stuff done recently! To start, I made another Scratch (turbowarp technically) project, which basically consists of a room with 3 screens, each one having some unique things in there to interact with. i highly suggest checking it out with the link 
[here ](https://dbshorts.github.io/Damians-Room/)
and looking for things that you can interact with yourself!

You may also have noticed the visible changes to the blog website. This is because I went with a different Jekyll theme, called the Hacker theme. I also added a custom header with some of my social medias (im working on getting that one fully put together)

Also, I plan on, at some point soon, building a Survive The Disasters (REMASTERED) Scratch Wiki page, which explains basically everything about the game. This includes:
- Maps
- Character Skins
- Disasters
- Power Ups

I have been wanting to do a wiki like this for a while for Survive The Disasters, but now I finally am thinking about how I can get it done. Spoiler alert: probably some GitHub Pages fun. Maybe I can learn how to make a Wiki using GitHub Pages. Either that, or im gonna use the GitHub Wikis feature. I just find it a lot more fun to put a bit of customization on it using GitHub Pages.

Anyways, i think im rambling, so im gonna end this blog post here. Hope anyone reading this has a great day! Bye!
