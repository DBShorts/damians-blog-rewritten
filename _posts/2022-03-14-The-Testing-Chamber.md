# The Testing Chamber
I made a new website recently called The Testing Chamber. The purpose of it is to test some interesting things involving Turbowarp

The things that are included in this website include:
- A scratch project that can send a message to Discord via webhooks and Javascript
- A scratch project that functions to test the Infinite Clones that Turbowarp can use and how the performance stays while using them  

Hope you guys like the website!  
Also, very sorry for the lack of blog posts recently, I have been sick and just forgot to post. Finally feeling better though, and ready to keep going with the blog!
