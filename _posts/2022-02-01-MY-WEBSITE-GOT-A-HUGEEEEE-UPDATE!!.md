# MY WEBSITE GOT A HUGEEEEE UPDATE!!
Right, this isnt huge like an overhaul or anything, but its huge in the sense that its absolutely CRAZY. Basically, earlier today, i was reading up on what the different Turbowarp Packager Cloud Variables can do. While doing this, i saw that modifying the redirect cloud variable automatically sends you to that page. Which is pretty awesome.

I know this was a very short post, but i dont wanna drag this on too long, just a quick announcement. Bye bye!
