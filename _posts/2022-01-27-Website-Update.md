# Website Update
Man, its hard to believe that i got all of this cool stuff done in one day. I started this blog, and now, I updated my website! Next I plan on releasing an update for Deltarune Battle Simulator Scratch, but for now, lets talk about the website.


First of all, I added Survive The Disasters Scratch. This is something that I added to my GitHub a little while back, however, it hadnt been added to the website yet. Now, it has been, and it seems to be working very well!

Next, I added Scratch Cloud Clicker. This is a surprising addition, since it was originally only meant to be a test for cloud variables on Turbowarp/GitHub. But, it worked so well, I decided to just keep it as a normal game.

And last, technically, because there is another, but its just the blog that you are on right now, so it doesnt matter, is Deltarune Battle Simulator Scratch! This has honestly been one of my favourite projects uploaded here, because I love dodging games like Deltarune and Undertale. Also, just gonna throw this in here, ***the incoming update is a big one.***
