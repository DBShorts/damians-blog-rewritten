# Where I have been!
Hey guys! So, as you guys can probably tell, I haven't used this blog in ages. You are probably wondering *why* I haven't used it in ages, and that's what I'm gonna talk about for this post.

To be entirely honest, recently I kinda stopped enjoying scratch as much as I used to. It just started feeling like a chore for whatever reason. Around that time, I also switched over to working on some Minecraft texture packs, which probably pulled me away from scratch even further. But suddenly today, all of a sudden, I actually ***wanted*** to do scratch projects and github stuff again. And so, I did, and here we are! I recently completely overhauled my website, I am working on bringing back some of my websites (DBZone, this blog, etc.)
With that, how about we actually talk about what I have been up to recently?

## Damians Minecraft Addons
---
Damians Minecraft Addons is my newest project, or more so, ***set*** of projects. So far, I have two texture packs, and a W.I.P. addon. I started working on these because I love Minecraft, and I wanted to make some cool texture packs that basically function as a tweak to the base game. And I definitely did that with my two texture packs. Lets get into that!

We will start with Vanilla Cake Variants, as its pretty simple. Vanilla Cake Variants is pretty much what it sounds like, variations for the existing cake in Minecraft. It basically just makes it so wherever you place a cake, it chooses a random texture to put on it, which really adds some personality to the cakes of Minecraft. Its very fun, and is great as a small addition to a survival or creative world.

Next, we have Armor Stand Anarchy. Armor Stand Anarchy is quite the texture pack, and a lot to explain. Basically, I was thinking about ways to add unique decorations to a Minecraft world, and I remembered that some packs use renamed mobs to have custom mob textures. I then thought, what if I applied the same concept to armor stands with unique decorations, and boom. Armor Stand Anarchy exists now, and its probably my biggest Minecraft project ever. Also, my friend sneakyninjaMX helps me with this pack because, when I was talking about the pack, he said he had the same idea and even made some models, but he hadn't figured out the code part yet. I had already gotten the code fully working, so we started working together to add a bunch of cool custom armor stands. We eventually even had the idea to start adding paintings using armor stands, and we have added many of those now too! As of writing this, Armor Stand Anarchy is working on version 3.0, and you can download it

## Updating and upgrading websites
---
As you may have noticed, my main website, [https://dbshorts.github.io/](https://dbshorts.github.io/), was completely overhauled today! The reasoning for this is because, to be entirely honest, the website was really old, somewhat glitchy, and overfilled with easter eggs. I loved the old easter eggs, I hate to see them go, but if it means the website loads better for people with worse internet, its worth it. Also, I kinda just wanted to refresh the website a little bit generally. The old "Socials" page was really old and literally even had some dead links (I have now replaced this with Linktree, because Linktree is easier to maintain and keep up to date.), some of the old code was really janky, etc.

Now that I have [https://dbshorts.github.io/](https://dbshorts.github.io/) updated, I plan on updating some more of my other sites, such as DBZone, maybe even this blog, and more. I am probably not gonna do overly much with these, although I will try to keep making posts on this blog and updates on DBZone, 


And thats about it for todays blog post. I will update you next time with more new info!
