# I made a Facebook group!
yeah, yeah, let out your "Facebook is only for grandmas and blah blah". If you believe that, feel free to just leave this blog post alone. For the people still reading, I made a Facebook group for posting quick updates and to let anyone comment on things! I will also be posting there every time I update my blog. The link is [www.facebook.com/groups/327218335972908](https://www.facebook.com/groups/327218335972908) and will be displayed at the top of the blog from now on.  
  anyways bye yall
