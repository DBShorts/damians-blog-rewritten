# Survive The Disasters has a wiki now!
For the past day I have been working on the wiki for Survive The Disasters Scratch, and its finally done! It has everything i wanted it to, including 
- Disasters, their difficulty level, and what they do
- Maps, what they look like, and what the Special Disaster for that map does
- Skins
- Power Ups and what they do

You can check it out at https://github.com/DBShorts/Survive-The-Disasters-Scratch/wiki , and this link will also be posted on the games original Scratch page.
