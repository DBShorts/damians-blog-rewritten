# I made a cool website!
Basically, just recently, i discovered that two Turbowarp packaged projects with the same Project ID can interact with each other via cloud variables. Using this, I was able to make a scratch project which I can remotely change with a file that i store on my computer. However, it is still a kinda buggy work in progress, but for the most part its functioning fine. You can find the link 
[here ](https://dbshorts.github.io/what-is-damian-doing/)
and once i fix up some of the bugs I will put it on my main website. Also, I have a new icon on my YouTube Shorts channel and discord profile. Both are linked at the top of this blog, or on my website.

Im ending this blog post now. Also, I plan to do a stream at ***some point*** soon.
